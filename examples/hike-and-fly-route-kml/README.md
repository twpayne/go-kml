# hike-and-fly-route-kml

This directory contains an example of using `go-kml` to generate a rich KML
file. It includes the use of the `icon` and `sphere` libraries. To run the
example, run:

    $ go run $GOPATH/src/github.com/twpayne/go-kml/examples/hike-and-fly-route-kml/main.go > route.kml

Then open the `route.kml` file in Google Earth.
